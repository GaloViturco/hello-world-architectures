# Hello World Architectures

This project demonstrates basic "Hello World" implementations for various software architecture styles. Each one is built independently using different technologies and is hosted in a separate GitHub repository (multi-repo structure).

| REST API     | Python   | [hola-mundo-rest](https://github.com/GaloViturco/hola-mundo-rest) |
| SOAP         | Python   | [hola-mundo-soap](https://github.com/GaloViturco/hola-mundo-soap) |
| Webhook      | Python   | [hola-mundo-webhook](https://github.com/GaloViturco/hola-mundo-webhook) |
| WebSocket    | Python   | [hola-mundo-websocket](https://github.com/GaloViturco/hola-mundo-websocket) |
| Socket.IO    | JavaScript (Node.js) | [hola-mundo-socketio](https://github.com/GaloViturco/hola-mundo-socketio) |
| gRPC         | Python   | [hola-mundo-grpc](https://github.com/GaloViturco/hola-mundo-grpc) |
